## Understanding Peer Review Preferences

Our research involved participants from diverse peer review experiences, with:
- 3 respondents from university courses outside COMPSCI4081 and COMPSCI4038
- 1 respondent with industry-related peer review experience (e.g., GitHub code reviews)
- All respondents were at the postgraduate level

## Key Findings from Survey Data

Analysis of general peer review preferences across different contexts revealed:

- **Preference for Anonymity**: 75% of respondents prefer anonymous reviews
- **Feedback Format Preferences**:
  - Written comments rated highest (4.5/5)
  - Numerical scores also valued (3.75/5)
  - Voice recordings rated lowest (3/5)
- **Task-Based vs. Writing-Based**: Overall preference for task-based feedback formats

## Student Motivations and Learning

- **Primary Motivations**:
  - Improving own skills through reviewing others
  - Learning different approaches to the same problem
  - Professional development (especially for coding reviews)
  
- **Learning Value**:
  - Task-Based: "Practical application of knowledge"
  - Writing-Based: "Learning from others' thinking and writing styles"
  - Several respondents noted learning new techniques from reviewing peers' work

## Challenges and Concerns

- **Relationship Concerns**: 75% of respondents mentioned potential conflicts between honesty and peer relationships
- **Time Constraints**: 25% reported insufficient time for thorough reviews
- **Fairness Perceptions**: Concerns about bias when reviewer identities are known

## Future Recommendations

- Implement **enhanced anonymity** measures to reduce bias (priority rating: 3/5)
- Develop **multi-round review** processes (priority rating: 2.25/5)
- Provide **instructor feedback on reviews** to improve quality (priority rating: 1.75/5)
- Ensure **real-time rubric access** during reviews (priority rating: 2.75/5)
