## Understanding the Full Picture

Peer review effectiveness can't be measured along a single dimension. This radar chart visualizes how coding and essay-based peer reviews compare across six key dimensions:

- **Grading Consistency**: How closely different reviewers' assessments align when evaluating the same work
- **Feedback Specificity**: The level of detail and actionable suggestions in reviews
- **Time Efficiency**: How much time is required for effective review completion
- **Student Engagement**: How actively involved students are in the review process
- **Learning Impact**: The measurable effect on learning outcomes
- **Implementation Ease**: How straightforward it is for instructors to set up and manage


### Key Insights

This visualization reveals several important findings:

1. **Complementary Strengths**: Coding and essay reviews excel in different areas, suggesting they might serve different pedagogical purposes.

2. **Consistency vs. Specificity Trade-off**: Coding reviews tend to have higher grading consistency but lower feedback specificity compared to essay reviews.

3. **Implementation Considerations**: The relative ease of implementing coding peer reviews might make them more approachable for instructors new to peer assessment.
