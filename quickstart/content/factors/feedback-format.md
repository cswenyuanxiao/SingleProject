## The Impact of Feedback Format on Peer Review

The format in which feedback is provided significantly influences the effectiveness of peer review. Our survey data reveals that students have distinct preferences for different feedback formats depending on the assignment type, and these preferences directly impact both the quality of feedback provided and the learning value derived.

## Feedback Format Preferences

{{< chart-wrapper height="400px" width="100%" >}}
<canvas id="formatPreferenceChart"
  data-labels='["Written comments", "Numerical scores", "Voice recordings"]'
  data-values='[4.5, 4, 3]'>
</canvas>
{{< /chart-wrapper >}}

The chart above shows student ratings of different feedback formats on a scale of 1-5. Written comments were rated as the most useful format (4.5/5), followed by numerical scores (4/5) and voice recordings (3/5).

## Assignment Type Preferences

Our survey revealed distinct preferences for feedback formats based on assignment type:

| Assignment Type | Preferred Format | Reason |
|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Writing-Based | Writing-Based | "Learning from others' thinking and writing styles" |
| Task-Based | Task-Based | "Practical application of knowledge" |

## Key Factors Influencing Format Effectiveness

Several factors influence the effectiveness of different feedback formats:

1. **Specificity**: Written comments allow for specific, targeted feedback on particular aspects of work
2. **Clarity**: Numerical scores provide clear, quantitative assessment but may lack explanatory detail
3. **Personalization**: Voice recordings can convey tone and nuance but may be less structured
4. **Efficiency**: Different formats require varying amounts of time for both reviewers and reviewees

## Student Feedback on Format Preferences

Representative comments from the survey regarding feedback format:

> "I think most assignments that require completion have standard answers, which is relatively simple for teachers to judge. However, in writing assignments, we can see the differences and distinctions in everyone's thinking, especially some students who are good at writing are worth learning from."
>
> "It's practical and I can apply the knowledge to use."
>
> "They are more objective in nature, rather than being influenced by personal styles."

## Learning Value by Format

Students reported different learning benefits from various feedback formats:

### Writing-Based Assignments

- **Strengths**: Exposure to different thinking styles, learning from well-written examples
- **Learning Value**: Development of critical thinking and writing skills
- **Student Quote**: "When I do peer review, I will find other people's writing problems, and I will also find other people's strengths in writing. I will combine my own situation to learn from their strengths and make up for my weaknesses to achieve my own breakthroughs."

### Task-Based Assignments

- **Strengths**: Practical application, exposure to different approaches to the same problem
- **Learning Value**: Technical skill development, algorithm efficiency
- **Student Quote**: "I learnt about a more efficient solution to the same problem including an algorithm I had not thought of."

## Format Effectiveness Across Different Review Dimensions

Different feedback formats show varying effectiveness across different dimensions of peer review:

| Dimension | Most Effective Format | Effectiveness Rating |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Identifying Errors | Written comments | 4.5/5 |
| Suggesting Improvements | Written comments | 4.5/5 |
| Overall Assessment | Numerical scores | 4/5 |
| Conveying Nuance | Voice recordings | 3/5 |

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on our survey data, we recommend:

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine written comments with numerical scores for most comprehensive feedback
2. **Format Matching**: Align feedback format with assignment type (e.g., code comments for coding assignments)
3. **Clear Guidelines**: Provide specific instructions on how to use each feedback format effectively
4. **Training**: Offer examples of high-quality feedback in different formats

## Conclusion

Feedback format significantly impacts the effectiveness of peer review, with written comments rated as the most useful overall. Different assignment types benefit from tailored feedback formats, with writing-based assignments focusing on thinking styles and task-based assignments emphasizing practical application. A hybrid approach that combines multiple formats can maximize the benefits of peer review across different dimensions.
