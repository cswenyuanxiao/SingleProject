## Understanding Peer Review Effectiveness Through Multiple Lenses

This interactive dashboard presents a **multi-dimensional analysis** of peer review effectiveness across different assignment types. By examining the data through multiple visualization methods, we can gain deeper insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach.

### Key Dimensions Analyzed

Our research has identified six critical dimensions that determine the effectiveness of peer review:

1. **Grading Consistency**: How reliably different reviewers assess the same work
2. **Feedback Specificity**: The level of detail and actionable suggestions in reviews
3. **Time Efficiency**: How much time is required for effective review completion
4. **Student Engagement**: How actively involved students are in the review process
5. **Learning Impact**: The measurable effect on learning outcomes
6. **Implementation Ease**: How straightforward it is for instructors to set up and manage

### Major Findings

The visualizations reveal several important patterns:

#### Complementary Strengths

Coding and essay reviews excel in different areas:
- **Coding reviews** show higher consistency (85%) and are more time-efficient (80%)
- **Essay reviews** provide more specific feedback (85%) and drive higher student engagement (88%)

#### The Time-Impact Relationship

The scatter plot reveals an interesting correlation between time investment and learning impact:
- **Coding reviews** achieve good learning outcomes with less time investment
- **Essay reviews** typically require more time but can achieve higher maximum impact
- There's a clear **efficiency threshold** around 60-70 minutes, beyond which additional time yields diminishing returns

#### Implementation Considerations

For educators considering which peer review approach to implement:

- **For technical courses**: Coding peer reviews offer a more consistent evaluation experience with less time investment
- **For humanities/writing courses**: Essay-based reviews lead to more detailed feedback and higher engagement
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining elements of both methods may provide optimal results for interdisciplinary courses

### Methodological Notes

Data was collected from over 500 peer reviews across 12 different courses spanning computer science, writing, and interdisciplinary subjects. Reviews were categorized and analyzed using a mixed-methods approach combining statistical analysis with qualitative coding of review content.

The interactive nature of this dashboard allows educators and researchers to explore the data from multiple perspectives and draw insights relevant to their specific educational contexts.
