## Longitudinal Analysis: Fall 2021 - Spring 2024

This time-series analysis examines the evolution of peer review quality over six consecutive academic terms, identifying key intervention points and their impact on overall effectiveness. By tracking multiple metrics consistently, we can clearly observe the trajectory of improvement and pinpoint which interventions yielded the greatest benefits.

### Key Metrics Tracked

The following metrics were measured consistently across all terms:

1. **Reviewer Consistency**: The degree to which different reviewers provide similar assessments for the same work. Higher consistency indicates more reliable review processes.

2. **Feedback Quality**: Measured through a combination of specificity, actionability, and constructiveness of comments.

3. **Student Satisfaction**: Self-reported satisfaction with the peer review process and perceived value of feedback received.

4. **Instructor Alignment**: The correlation between peer reviews and instructor assessments of the same work.

5. **Completion Rate**: The percentage of assigned peer reviews that were completed on time.

### Major Trends Observed

Over the six terms studied, several significant trends emerged:

- **Reviewer Consistency** showed the most dramatic improvement, rising from 42% in Fall 2021 to 78% in Spring 2024. This indicates that reviews have become much more reliable and standardized.

- **Feedback Quality** improved steadily, with notable jumps following the implementation of structured rubrics in Fall 2022 and AI-assisted feedback in Fall 2023.

- **Student Satisfaction** experienced a temporary dip in Spring 2022 but recovered strongly and reached its highest level (82%) by Spring 2024.

- **Instructor Alignment** showed consistent improvement across all terms, suggesting better alignment between peer and expert assessment.

- **Completion Rate** fluctuated somewhat but generally trended upward, with peaks in Fall 2022 (84%) and Fall 2023 (88%).

### Impact of Intervention Points

Each term featured a specific intervention aimed at improving the peer review process:

- **Spring 2022**: Introduction of reviewer training programs resulted in an 11% improvement in reviewer consistency but only modest gains in other metrics.

- **Fall 2022**: Implementation of structured review rubrics led to significant improvements across all metrics, with feedback quality increasing by 7% and completion rates jumping by 12%.

- **Spring 2023**: Adoption of double-blind review process particularly improved instructor alignment (+6%) and student satisfaction (+4%).

- **Fall 2023**: Integration of AI-assisted feedback tools created substantial improvements in feedback quality (+6%) and completion rates (+9%).

- **Spring 2024**: A comprehensive approach combining all previous interventions resulted in continued improvements across all metrics.

### Seasonal Variations

Interestingly, we observed consistent patterns between fall and spring terms:

- Fall terms generally showed higher completion rates but lower student satisfaction compared to the subsequent spring terms.
- Reviewer consistency typically improved more dramatically in fall terms, possibly due to new training initiatives coinciding with the academic year start.

### Implementation Insights

Based on this longitudinal analysis, we can draw several valuable insights:

1. **Compounding Benefits**: Each intervention built upon previous improvements, creating a compounding effect over time.

2. **Structured Guidance**: The introduction of structured rubrics in Fall 2022 appears to have been a critical turning point, significantly improving both the quality and consistency of reviews.

3. **Technology Enhancement**: AI-assisted feedback tools proved highly effective at improving both the quality and completion rate of reviews.

4. **Comprehensive Approach**: The highest overall quality was achieved in Spring 2024 when all interventions were used in combination.

### Methodological Notes

Data collection involved consistent measurement techniques across all terms:

- Each term involved at least 120 students and 360+ individual peer reviews
- Measurements were taken using the standardized PRMQ (Peer Review Metrics Questionnaire)
- Consistency calculations used Cohen's kappa coefficient to assess inter-reviewer reliability
- External validation by education assessment specialists was conducted each term
