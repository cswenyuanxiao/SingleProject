## Characteristics of Effective Peer Feedback

Providing high-quality peer review feedback is a skill that can be learned and refined. This guide presents examples of effective feedback across different disciplines, highlighting the key characteristics that make feedback valuable to recipients. Use these models to improve your own feedback practices.

### What Makes Feedback Effective?

Research on peer review consistently shows that the most helpful feedback shares several key characteristics:

1. **Specific**: Points to exact elements rather than making general statements
2. **Actionable**: Offers clear, implementable suggestions for improvement
3. **Balanced**: Acknowledges strengths while identifying areas for growth
4. **Constructive**: Focuses on improvement rather than criticism
5. **Prioritized**: Addresses the most important issues rather than minor details
6. **Objective**: Based on established criteria rather than personal preference
7. **Supportive**: Uses language that encourages rather than discourages

The examples in this guide demonstrate these principles across different academic and professional contexts. By examining both effective and ineffective examples, you can identify patterns to apply in your own peer review practice.

### The Impact of Quality Feedback

When done well, peer feedback serves multiple purposes:

- Helps the recipient improve their work
- Develops critical thinking skills in the reviewer
- Creates a community of practice with shared standards
- Builds communication skills valuable in professional settings

Studies show that students who receive specific, actionable feedback show significantly greater improvement in subsequent work compared to those who receive vague or overly critical feedback. Additionally, the skills developed through giving effective feedback transfer to other academic and professional contexts.

### Using This Resource

Browse through the tabs to see examples of different types of effective feedback. Each example includes:

- An actual feedback sample

After reviewing these examples, use the checklist in the sidebar to evaluate your own feedback before submitting it.

Remember that the goal of peer review is not to find fault, but to help others improve their work through constructive, actionable insights based on clear criteria and delivered with respect.
